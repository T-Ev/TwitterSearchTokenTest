Nevermind it works in incognito now thanks the mad lad [@512x512 (Yaroslav)](https://twitter.com/512x512/status/1595612720497590273?s=20&t=-52KSb0xbmOJMpa6qqz9AA) who is an API BEAST! Give him a follow!

Copy and paste the contents of script.js into the JS console of any twitter page with a search bar (i.e. [https://twitter.com/explore](https://twitter.com/explore)

I tried to keep it as simple as possible.
